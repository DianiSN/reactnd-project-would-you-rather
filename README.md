# Would you Rather Project

An app that lets the user play the game "Would you rather...?". The game works in this way: You pick one of the two options available for the question. The app shows the user how many people have chosen either of the answers and also shows the user which questions they have answered and which ones are unanswered. The user is able to make their own questions as well for them and other users to answer.
